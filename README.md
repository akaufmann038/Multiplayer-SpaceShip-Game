# Multiplayer-SpaceShip-Game

Built a web application which allows authenticated users to engage in a live-messaging chat and battle each
other in a live spaceship-like game within the web browser.

Developed a REST API using Flask for Python to handle user authentication, created the spaceship game using
vanilla Javascript, and utilized Socket IO to send the game data between users.
